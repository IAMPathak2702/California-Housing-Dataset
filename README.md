# End to End Machine learning Project 
# California Dreaming: Unveiling the Future of Home Prices in the Golden State

This project aims to predict housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains information about housing districts in California, including features such as median income, median house value, population, and more.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the California housing dataset, which contains the following columns:

- `longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the district.
- `latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the district.
- `housing_median_age`: Median age of the houses in the district.
- `total_rooms`: Total number of rooms in the district.
- `total_bedrooms`: Total number of bedrooms in the district.
- `population`: Total population in the district.
- `households`: Total number of households in the district.
- `median_income`: Median income of the people living in the district.
- `median_house_value`: Median house value for households in the district
